## Long term support & compatibility

- Latest major releases are actively maintained and supported
- Previous major releases are not actively maintained, but important fixes will be accepted
- Oldest supported PHP versions are dropped only with major releases
- Support for older versions of libraries is not dropped as long as compatibility code is not too complex
- Support for newest versions of dependencies (PHP and libraries) is usually added shortly after their release

In case you have requirements which are not listed here, consider contacting and sponsoring us.
